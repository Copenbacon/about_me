  <p>As a working professional beginning to get a handle on web development, I want to begin showcasing some of my work. This site is a continual work in progress and
    as such will reflect changes over time.</p>

  <p> My professional background includes founding two startups in Boston, MA with a lifelong friend, Travis Lowry. We began with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Rainbow-Chronicle-297693440261117/?fref=ts">Rainbow Chronicle</a> which became OutGrade. They were attempts at creating an LGBT site in the vein of Yelp in order to identify LGBT friendly places around the country. After working for 3 years full time on the project, many LGBT rights issues came to the forefront of politics and while discrimination still exists for many LGBT members out there we pivoted our focus to <a href="http://www.soonspoon.com"> SoonSpoon</a>, a site which provided last minute restaurant reservations to hungry diners. This pivot turned out to be very successful and after a year of operation SoonSpoon was acquired by Reserve Media.</p>

  <p> After the acquisition, I chose to pursue interests in the culinary field and took up a job cooking in Boston. Shortly after, I returned home to Texas for a short while and found myself moving up to Seattle, WA in June of 2015 where I continued my pursuit of cooking and worked for a little over a year in a professional kitchen in downtown Seattle. I am currently pursuing education  at <ahref="http://www.codefellows.com">CodeFellows</a> where I hope to become proficient in web development.></p>
